Side elements: Subtle, refined guardrail structures (not prison bars, but elegant constraints). The path is clear, directed, safe because of the guardrails. Colors: TCU blue (#0C326F) for structure, gold (#D4AF37) for the path. Style: Architectural, refined, symbolizing 'controlled freedom'. Clean institutional white background. 4K, 16:9.
