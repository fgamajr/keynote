A highly polished system architecture flowchart. Starting from a simple code icon on the left (YAML Configuration), branching outward horizontally into a complex but neat vertical tree of rounded rectangular blocks labeled as test phases (using soft olive greens and muted salmon/orange tones representing distinct AI robustness tests). Arrows elegantly trace the processing flow from left to right, all converging into a formal structured document icon ('LaTeX Report Final Audit Trail'). Apple Keynote flow style, clean engineering corporate aesthetic, off-white background. 4K, 16:9.
