A presentation layout divided into two thematic sides. On the left, a sleek, beautifully angled dark-mode terminal window showing lines of Python code and a glowing output: 'Result: Idempotent. 16,501 Records Verified.' On the right, a stacked pillar of 5 clean, slightly overlapping horizontal rectangles in soft muted colors (sand, slate, pale green) representing 'Anti-Hallucination Layers'. At the bottom, a minimalist equation with small elegant icons (a seed bag, a group of people, a calendar) summing up to a pure mathematical certainty. Off-white background, Apple Keynote style. 4K, 16:9.
