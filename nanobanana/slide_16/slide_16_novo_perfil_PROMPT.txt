A clean, minimalist presentation slide balancing human and metric elements. On the left side, an elegant vertical list with subtle beautiful icons (a terminal prompt, a speech bubble, an orbit node, a gear) defining the human's new roles: Coder, Interpreter, Orchestrator, Engineer. On the right side, a very simple, sleek bar chart comparing a towering muted-orange bar labeled '~10 months' with a dramatically shorter soft-sage-green bar labeled '~2 months'. A glassmorphism tooltip floats above the empty space indicating 'Reinvested in Analytical Depth'. Pure white background, calm and inspiring corporate tech aesthetic. 4K, 16:9.
