Top-down view of a winding mountain road crossing topographical lines. The road curves elegantly around invisible obstacles. Overlaying the road is a faint, dashed straight line connecting a starting dot to an ending dot. Super clean, Apple-style illustration. Colors: soft grays, minimal blue accents for the winding road, pure white background. 4K, 16:9.
