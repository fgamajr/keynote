A masterfully organized 3-column executive summary dashboard on a pure white background. Left column: Glassmorphism cards highlighting massive numeric impacts like 'R$ 51 Billion' and '210+ Memos'. Center column: A wide, elegant frosted-glass panel listing 'Impossible Feats' with tiny, sharp minimalist icons next to bullet points (3.7M records analyzed, 12.8M CPFs crossed). Right column: A sleek vertical roadmap with subtle arrows pointing to future milestones like 'Academic Publication (RTCU)' and 'YAML Template'. A very subtle, out-of-focus background hint of modern IDE code editor. Extremely polished Apple Keynote finale aesthetic. 4K, 16:9.
